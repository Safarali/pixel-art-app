#### Pixel-Art App

The mail goal of this app is to build a canvas, a 30x30 “pixels” matrix. When the app starts, there is a blank canvas showing up.
There is also a color picker, which shows the colors you can use. A default color is pre-selected when the app starts.
When you click one pixel in the canvas, that pixel will be colored with that default color.

Given the UI that is showed above, we basically need 3 components.

1.  One is the Pixel, a single unit that will compose our drawing.
2.  One is the Canvas, which is a set of 30 rows, each containing 30 Pixel components.
3.  The last one is the ColorPicker, which contains one or more Pixels components.
Clicking a Pixel component inside a ColorPicker will change the active color.
Clicking a Pixel component inside a Canvas will change the background color of the pixel.
